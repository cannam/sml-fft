A Fast Fourier Transform implementation in Standard ML.

  https://bitbucket.org/cannam/sml-fft

Intended to be reasonably fast rather than beautiful. No dependencies
apart from the Basis library. Supports power-of-two sizes only.

Chris Cannam, cannam@all-day-breakfast.com, modelled on the Nayuki
multi-language implementation
(http://www.nayuki.io/page/free-small-fft-in-multiple-languages).
